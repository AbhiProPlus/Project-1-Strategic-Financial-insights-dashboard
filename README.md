Financial Data Analysis - Power BI Project

Overview
This project involves the analysis of financial data to derive insights for business improvement and decision-making. The data includes sales, profit, and discount information across various countries, segments, and products. The analysis was performed using Power BI, with the objective of identifying key trends, opportunities, and challenges for the company.

Key Insights

1. Country-Wise Analysis
Germany: Exhibits low discounts and enjoys high profitability. This suggests a strategy focused on premium pricing or cost control.
United States: Experiences high discounts but low profit, indicating a potential issue with discounting strategies that may be eroding profit margins.
France: Has the highest profit overall. This is the most lucrative market for the company.

2. Product-Wise Analysis
Paseo: The highest-selling and most profitable product, especially in France. This product is a key driver of profitability.
Carretera: The product with the lowest profit, but interestingly, France also leads in sales of this product. This suggests that Carretera may have pricing or cost challenges, especially in France.

3. Segment-Wise Analysis
Government Segment: Dominates with the highest sales (44%) and profit (65%). This segment is the most important for the company’s financial health.
Midmarket Segment: On the other end, this segment shows the lowest profit, contributing only 3.7% of total profit. It indicates an area for improvement in terms of pricing, product offerings, or customer engagement.

Recommendations

Review Discounting Strategy in the US: The high discounts are not translating into profits. Revisiting the discounting model or optimizing costs could help improve profitability.
Focus on Carretera in France: Since Carretera is underperforming profit-wise despite high sales in France, a detailed cost and pricing review is needed to boost its profitability.
Leverage Paseo's Success: Paseo is a high performer and should be promoted more aggressively in underperforming regions, or its pricing adjusted to capitalize on its high demand.
Midmarket Strategy Overhaul: The midmarket segment's poor profit performance suggests that changes in marketing, pricing, or customer targeting could enhance this segment’s profitability.
